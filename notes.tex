Notes on SHP failure under circulant lift
Constructed code in Matlab which checks if $S_{x}$, $G_{x}$, $G_{a}$, $S_{z}$ follow the proper commutation relations before and after lifting via circulants.


The lift is the following procedure:

Take the SHP product of Base matrices and then do circulant lift:


Trivial Example tried first:

\begin{equation}
   \boldsymbol{H}= \begin{bmatrix}
    2&1&1\\
    1&2&0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   \boldsymbol{G}= \begin{bmatrix}
    0&1&2

\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Both of these matrices are mod 3

Using SHP product with base matrices: successfully captures SHP commutation relations between gauge ops and stabilizers. 

After Lift: significant failure.  Resultant matrices are not even close to being all 0's . Too large to input here. 
    

It seems that this example shows that circulant lift procedure on this product does not necessarily preserve the commutation relations. 
I'm going to check on my lifting procedure to see why its not working. This might be a key issue
